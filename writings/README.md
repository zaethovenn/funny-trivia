for our project I will be going with the translation route of translating one language into another with a simple program. i will most likely be changing c into java with a simple translation code.

project proposal

For my project I will be taking the project 1 track of creating our own programming language with the use of python. I felt I would do best in this project track because we did creation of our own project file during our time in class. In my design i want to make a programming language that deals with something that will interest me. Most likely i wanted to make a program that could spit out facts to the user when asking questions pertaining it. In my language you could input a number and with that number the random information fact could spit out. the purpose of the language is to just get users more informed on random facts that i enjoy stating. It wont be the most complicated language because if i can understand it i can believe my peers will aswell. I will in all create a programming language that will act as a fact reader for whatever number a user inputs. The user will use a command line prompt in order to get these facts displayed.
